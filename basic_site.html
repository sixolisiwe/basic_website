                    <li> District Six was an area of Cape Town in 
                      the nineteen seventies that housed
                      almost one tenth of the population of 
                      Cape Town. In the year 1965 the apartheid 
                        government at the time stated that District 
                          Six was now a “white” area.</li>
                    <li> This resulted in more than sixty thousand people 
                            being forced to move and relocate to the Cape Flats. </li>
                    <li> Exciting guided tours are offered of the area which are conducted by a genuine
                           ex-resident of the original District Six. 
                           In doing this, you are going to gain a real sense of what
                           it was like for the people back in those days. </li>

                          Under the umbrella theme, ‘From human wrongs to human rights”.
                           Exhibitions on the lower level of this museum explore the long history of slavery in South Africa. </li>
                    <li> Through the changing, temporary exhibitions the museum addresses issues around

                        <li>The square is large and cobbled, with ancient trees surrounding it along
                           with beautiful old heritage buildings. The vibe there is always amazing, too. </li>
